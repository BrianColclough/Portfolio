# My Personal Portfolio as an aspiring Software Engineer/Web Developer

## Resume and Pictures

Pictures are my own, I am a hobbyist photographer and I just want a way to share my images.

This website is meant to highlight my skills as a developer. I have many more features that I want to add, and I am slowly getting there, so expect regular updates to the website. 

This project is built on **NextJS** and for styling I am using **TailwindCSS**
