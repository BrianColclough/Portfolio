# How I got my first job as a new college graduate with no experience

Graduating college is scary, trust me I know, there’s lots of stress about figuring out what you want to do and even after you figure that out you have to land a job.

This post is mostly intended for computer science and particularly software engineering student’s or people who want to land a job in that field.

## How Much Do you *Need* to Study
When I was graduation I was studying my data strutting and algorithms all the time, I tried to spend time everyday doing leetcode problems so I would be prepared for the interview. I think this topic is blown way out of proportion. While, yes, during my interviews I did encounter some coding questions that I had to solve with hashmaps most of my interviews were very basic coding questions. I would say that I even studied too much. This question of how much to study though is very subjective and could change based on the kind of job you are going for. For me I have a job at a standard FinTech company, not at a FAANG (MAANG? MANGA?) company, so if you are trying to get a job at one of those you are going to have a different experience to me.
